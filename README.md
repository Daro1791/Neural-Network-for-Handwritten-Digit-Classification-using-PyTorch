# Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Classification using PyTorch

This project involves creating a neural network to classify images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each representing a digit between 0 and 9.

## Project Overview

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed: `torch`, `torchvision`, and `matplotlib`. These can be installed via pip.

### Project Structure
1. **Import Libraries**: Start by importing PyTorch and other essential libraries.
2. **Detect GPU**: Check if a GPU is available to leverage faster computation.
3. **Download and Visualize the Dataset**: Download the MNIST dataset and visualize sample images to understand the data.
4. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance accurately.
5. **Define the Neural Network Model**: Create a simple neural network with an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer.
6. **Define Loss Function and Optimizer**: Use a loss function to measure the model's performance and an optimizer to update the model's parameters.
7. **Create DataLoaders**: Use DataLoaders to handle batching and shuffling of the dataset, which improves memory efficiency and training performance.
8. **Training and Validation Loop**: Implement functions to train the model on the training set and validate its performance on the validation set.
9. **Prediction on Test Data**: Make predictions on test data to evaluate the model's generalization capability.
