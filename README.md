# Neural-Network-for-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-PyTorch
This project involves creating a neural network to classify images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each representing a digit between 0 and 9.
